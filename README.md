# Identity Suite

## Identity Suite – Digital Identity for All
Identity Suite is a collection of applications and developer tools that provide an accessible entry into digital identity for everyone, everywhere. Built on-top of the IOTA Identity Protocols using a familiar JavaScript front end, Certify & Vira can enable any developer an easy entry into the Digital Identity space and will provide a platform for the easy creation of proof of concept and future solutions for any developer, business, organisation, or SME, with basic js knowledge.

## Project Information
Digital Identity for Everyone, Everywhere.
The Identity Suite project has been created to hopefully help enable ease of access into the digital identity space for organisations, institutions, businesses, and individuals. The IOTA Identity Protocols are some of the most powerful in the IOTA eco-system and we are aiming to demonstrate this through the project.
With the IOTA eco-system especially suited the IoT side of things, we are seeing some amazing initiatives, partnerships, research, and developments using IOTA Identity, that solve a huge number of current edge challenges.
Where we focus is on the human aspect of digital identity.
The use of Digital Identity for organisations and individuals offers countless solutions across a range of industries and institutional sectors. From government to education, healthcare to finance, retail through to real estate. And within these sectors, it covers a range of versatile use cases such as personal identity, licensing, registration, certification, insurance, medical documentation, passports, and so much more. 
With such scope for social development in this space, we have channelled our focus towards creating the Identity Suite, that can introduce these solutions and make IOTA Identity easily accessible for organisations and businesses around the world. 


## What is Identity Suite?
Identity Suite is a collection of applications and developer tools that can enable full management of the IOTA Identity Protocols. Our goal being the creation of a foundation stack that can allow ease of integration into the technology, providing solutions that can be implemented around the world, to empower a safer, more secure, and inclusive future.
The project is made up of two main applications, with a number of additional modules and integrations that leverage the IOTA Identity Protocols, which have been built by the talented developers at the IOTA Foundation in line with the W3C standardised guidelines for Digital Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

## Certify
The primary application of the suite Certify is Digital Identity for Organisations. Enabling Governments, Businesses, and Institutions the ability to manage their identities and to subsequently create and issue verifiable credentials to individual identity holders, with ease.
Certify will be a three-tier application consisting of a public front end, a user dashboard, and an organisation dashboard. The system is designed for businesses and organisations to control their digital identity, and to create further identities and verifiable credentials, for signing and issuing to other identity holders, be it a business, an individual, or a device.
The system will be fully integrated with the IOTA Identity protocols, as well as include our additional client tools, APIs, and DNS/DID protocols that we are building. The User dashboard can allow any identity holder to then create decentralized public profiles, that can operate permissioned access to verifiable credentials to allow publicly visible decentralized profiling, for registries and directories, or even permissioned marketplaces, etc…
Essentially with the Certify application you can manage and make use of pretty much the entire Digital Identity Protocol system.

## Vira
The second application, Vira, is Digital Identity for Individuals. A mobile identity wallet that offers Self-Sovereign Identity to its holder. Allowing anyone the ability to own and control their Digital Identity and Credentials. Putting the privacy back in the hands of the identity owner.
The Core of the system is built upon wallet and stronghold, allowing secure management and communication of keys and other sensitive data. We are using the same security and encryption protocols as the Firefly wallet, enabling us to make it an easily transferable system – ie our identity module is being built to potentially be inserted into the firefly wallet in the future.
Within Vira a user can create multiple identities, and within these identities can control profiles, which are collections of their chosen verifiable credentials, that can be permissioned, to create multiple different profiles, within an individual identity.
These are then permissioned through a domain access API that can allow the profile to be shared as a decentralized profile, on an unlimited number of websites, registers, databases, etc…
