# Identity Suite

## Identity Suite â€“ Digital Identity for All
Identity Suite is a collection of applications and developer tools that provide an accessible entry into digital identity for everyone, everywhere. Built on-top of the IOTA Identity Protocols using a familiar JavaScript front end, Certify & Vira can enable any developer an easy entry into the Digital Identity space and will provide a platform for the easy creation of proof of concept and future solutions for any developer, business, organisation, or SME, with basic js knowledge.

## Project Information
Digital Identity for Everyone, Everywhere.
The Identity Suite project has been created to hopefully help enable ease of access into the digital identity space for organisations, institutions, businesses, and individuals. The IOTA Identity Protocols are some of the most powerful in the IOTA eco-system and we are aiming to demonstrate this through the project.
With the IOTA eco-system especially suited the IoT side of things, we are seeing some amazing initiatives, partnerships, research, and developments using IOTA Identity, that solve a huge number of current edge challenges.
Where we focus is on the human aspect of digital identity.
The use of Digital Identity for organisations and individuals offers countless solutions across a range of industries and institutional sectors. From government to education, healthcare to finance, retail through to real estate. And within these sectors, it covers a range of versatile use cases such as personal identity, licensing, registration, certification, insurance, medical documentation, passports, and so much more. 
With such scope for social development in this space, we have channelled our focus towards creating the Identity Suite, that can introduce these solutions and make IOTA Identity easily accessible for organisations and businesses around the world.
